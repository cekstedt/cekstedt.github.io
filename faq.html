Miller</a>.</p><h3>But ... why?</h3><p>This started as a lockdown project so I could learn some programming wizardry. I used to be just some sad warehouse worker, but now I'm sitting on a goldmine of upwards of 11 and a half pageviews!</p><h3>What else can it do?</h3><p>Hovering your mouse over a Cash Phrase will display the official definition.</p><p>Clicking a Cash Phrase will take you directly to that phrase's entry on CashPhrases.org.</p><p>The arrow keys can be used to navigate backwards and forwards through haikus that have been generated since you loaded the webpage (up to a maximum of 1000, for memory purposes).</p><p>Clicking the "Generate" button again will generate a new haiku and return you to the end of the list.</p><h3>How can I support this?</h3><p>Most importantly, please join the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cashinginwithtjmiller">Cashing In Patreon</a>, to allow Cash & T.J. to continue crafting their comedy stylings.</p><p>Please also visit and contribute to <a href="https://www.cashphrases.org/">cashphrases.org</a>, without which this project would have been impossible.</p><h3>How do I contact you?</h3><p>Any suggestions / issues / bugs / compliments / scathing reviews / exciting timeshare opportunities can be sent to <a href="mailto:dashishiku@gmail.com">dashishiku@gmail.com</a>.</p><br><h3>Changelog:</h3><p>Version 2.2 - January 20, 2021:</p><ul><li>Added history and arrow key functionality.</li><li>Added additional functions list to this FAQ.</li><li>Multiple small fixes and additions.</li></ul><p>Version 2.1 - December 27, 2020:</p><ul><li>Added Cash Phrase total checking to guarantee at least one Cash Phrase per haiku.</li><li>Some stylesheet reworking and gulp.js workflow added.</li><li>Additional miscellaneous phrases added to database.</li></ul><p>Version 2.0 - November 28, 2020:</p><ul><li>Complete rewrite of source code.</li><li>Added Cash Phrase definitions on hovertext, and links to CashPhrases.org.</li></ul><p>Version 1.1 - November 16, 2020:</p><ul><li>Fixed capitalization and punctuation issues.</li></ul><p>Version 1.0 - November 14, 2020:</p><ul><li>Website creation.</li></ul></body></html>
